        My name is Austin Kilduff and I'm a campus minister in Boston, Massachusetts with the <a class="link-green" href="https://ccojubilee.org">CCO (Coalition for Christian Outreach)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in Canton, Ohio and considered myself an atheist from a young age. However, it wasn't until about halfway through my time at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts that I first critically assessed my disbelief in God. This began a period of spiritual exploration that led me to know "the radiance of the glory of God" (Hebrews 1:3) in Christ Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was first acquainted with the CCO in 2018 when a mentor from my church joined staff and began a partnership between the CCO and <a class="link-green" href="https://cotcboston.org">Church of the Cross</a>, my home church in Boston. The CCO group in Boston has been a major blessing in my life and a wonderful way to grow in fellowship. I learned more about the CCO when our group attended Jubilee in 2019 and I heard about the Fellowship Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a class="link-green" href="https://ccojubilee.org/fellows">Fellowship Program</a> is a 1-year campus ministry experience that allows recent grads to minister to students while growing under an experienced staff member. The Fellowship was a great fit for me, giving me the opportunity to explore this calling while growing through real-world ministry experience. After a period of discernment I was invited to spend the 2019-2020 school year serving the Lord in Fresno. This was a wonderful and formative year, and you can read stories of students I worked with on <a class="link-green" href="/">my blog.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the 2020-2021 school year, I'll be continuing work with the CCO, back at Church of the Cross in Boston to work with students at Northeastern University and Wentworth Institute of Technology. I'm excited to be back at CotC and Northeastern, and to forge new relationships with Wentworth students.
